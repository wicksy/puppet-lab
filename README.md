puppet-lab
==========
Mostly stuff played about with whilst learning Puppet at home with
a 2.7 VM from puppetlabs docs and training video shorts. Mostly
crap now but still useful on odd occassions to refer back to, 
mainly to see how badly I used to write stuff.

Newer stuff is in the foreman-lab elsewhere on github as it's stuff
done after the 2.7 stuff whilst developing provisioning processes
for theforeman and the puppet master that comes with it. Not
brilliant but still learning the ropes but still stuff that seems 
to work well out in the field albeit lacking some style and extensibility
(and portability).

Newer stuff will appear here post Puppet Practitioner course so
I now have an idea around recommended module architecture, style
and layout.
