puppet-lab
==========
Mostly stuff played about with whilst learning Puppet at home with
a 2.7 VM from puppetlabs docs and training video shorts. Mostly
crap now but still useful on odd occassions to refer back to, 
mainly to see how badly I used to write stuff.

Newer stuff is in the foreman-lab elsewhere github as it's stuff
done under the puppet master that comes with theforeman. Again
not brilliant but still learning the ropes but still stuff that
seemed to work well out in the field albeit lacking consistent
style.

Newer stuff will appear here post Puppet Practitioner course so
I now have an idea around recommended module architecture, style
and layout.
